# About The Project

The objective of this project is to train a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent to play a car game, where the agent must avoid collisions with other cars on the road, combining game development and reinforcement learning.

The DQN (Deep Q-Network) algorithm was developed by DeepMind in 2015. It was able to solve a wide range of Atari games (some to superhuman level) by combining reinforcement learning and deep neural networks at scale. The algorithm was developed by enhancing a classic RL algorithm called Q-Learning with deep neural networks and a technique called experience replay.[https://www.tensorflow.org/agents/tutorials/0_intro_rl]
